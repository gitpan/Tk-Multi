Tk_Multi is a set of Tk composite widget to allow you to manage
several scrolled Text or Canvas (or your own Multi widget) widgets
in your Toplevel window. 

The manager allows you to hide or show any managed text window through a menu.

Tk::Multi::* widgets uses packAdjust to increase, decrease the window 
size, and a menu to print its content. 

The Multi::Any class is deprecated. It will be removed in the next release.
I hope that not too many people were using it (I doubt it because I had 
no question about it :-/ )

This module was written with perl5.005 and now works fine with Tk800.010.

See the embedded documentation in the module for more details.

Comments and suggestions are always welcome.

Note that this module is in beta state. Its interface may still change 
(but I don't think so)

I'd like people who actually use this module for their application to
drop me a short note about what they're using this module for. 

Beta exit criteria:
- When some peoples (well, say 10 guys) tell me that they've used it 
  and did not find major bug with the module or minor problems with the 
  interface.

Many thanks to Larry W. Virden, Achim Bohnet for all the tests, patches
(and reports) they made. Many bugs were fixed and improvements were 
included thanks to their efforts.
