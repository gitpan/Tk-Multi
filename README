Tk_Multi is a set of Tk composite widget to allow you to manage
several scrolled Text windows in your Toplevel window. 

The manager allows you through a menu to hide or show any managed text window.

The text windows also have menus to increase, decrease the window size, and 
a menu to print its content.


This module was written with perl5.004 and now works fine with Tk402.003.

See the embedded documentation in the module for more details.

Comments and suggestions are always welcome.

Note that this module is in alpha state. Its interface may change (but
I hope not).

Alpha exit criteria:
- When some peoples (well, say 10 guys) tell me that they've used it 
  and did not find major bug with the module or minor problems with the 
  interface.

Legal mumbo jumbo:
