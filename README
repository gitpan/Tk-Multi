Tk_Multi is a set of Tk composite widget to allow you to manage
several scrolled Text or Canvas (or your own Multi widget) widgets in
your Toplevel window.

The manager allows you to hide or show any managed text window through
a menu.

Tk::Multi::* widgets uses Adjuster to increase, decrease the window
size, and a menu to print its content.

The Multi::Any class is deprecated. It will was removed in this
release.  I hope that not too many people were using it (I doubt it
because I had no question about it :-/ )

This module was written with perl5.005 and now works fine with
Tk800.010.

See the embedded documentation in the module for more details.

Comments and suggestions are always welcome.

Note that this module is in beta state. Its interface may still change
(but I don't think so)

I'd like people who actually use this module for their application to
drop me a short note about what they're using this module for.

Many thanks to Larry W. Virden, Achim Bohnet for all the tests, patches
(and reports) they made. Many bugs were fixed and improvements were 
included thanks to their efforts.


TO DO (well, bugs...): 
----------------------

- There's some kind of geometry or size conflict between the Adjuster,
the frames that are created by the Multi::Manager and the user who
tries to resize the window. Hopefully, I'll find a way to sort this
out, but I'd appreciate some help on this.

- The Adjuster does not follow closely the mouse pointer. This is an
Adjuster bug. I can't do much about it.

- The print pop-up menu should be replaced by a modified version of
Albert W. Dorrington's  PrintDialog.
