Tk_Multi is a set of Tk composite widget to allow you to manage
several scrolled Text or Canvas or TFrame (aka titled frame) widgets
in your Toplevel window.

The manager allows you to hide or show any managed text window through
a menu.

Tk::Multi::* widgets uses Adjuster to increase, decrease the window
size, and a menu to print its content.

This module was last tested with perl5.00804 and needs Tk804.027.

See the embedded documentation in the module for more details.

Comments and suggestions are always welcome.

Note that this module is in beta state. Its interface may still change
(but I don't think so)

I'd like people who actually use this module for their application to
drop me a short note about what they're using this module for.

Many thanks to Larry W. Virden, Achim Bohnet for all the tests,
patches (and reports) they made. Many bugs were fixed and improvements
were included thanks to their efforts.


TO DO (well, bugs...): 
----------------------

- The print pop-up menu should be replaced by a modified version of
Albert W. Dorrington's PrintDialog. Once this is done, the
Tk::Multi::Any class will be removed.


Legal mumbo jumbo:
